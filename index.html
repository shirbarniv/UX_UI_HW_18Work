                        <p>
                            Though most people love to travel, many will tell you that the most stressful part 
                            of traveling is budgeting their plans. To ease the travel experience, I designed a 
                            mobile budgeting app called Budget Buddy. By creating a platform for users to input 
                            spending budgets, add expenses and review financial statistics throughout their trip, 
                            I successfully helped users get the most out of their travel experience without breaking 
                            the bank or feeling overwhelmed.

                        <p>
                            With the rise of COVID-19 pre-quarantine, individuals began to feel powerless on how to 
                            better protect themselves against the virus. In the midst of it all, my 3-person team 
                            and I strived to create an app to help Apple Watch users meet the CDC hand-washing requirements. 
                            From onboarding to permission enabling to push notifications and stat visualizations, we created 
                            Wash: The App thatâ€™ll keep your hands clean.

                        <p>
                            As stay-at-home orders prevail around the world, there has been an upsurge in domestic violence 
                            and homelessness. In an attempt to help, my 4-person team and I reached out to Rose Haven, a 
                            non-profit aiming to help homeless women and non-binary people. We wanted to see if we can help 
                            them help others by creating a smoother user experience through their website. The new Rose Haven 
                            website was redesigned with visitors in mind, helping them achieve access to resources and services 
                            at greater ease. Simultaneously, we provided a quicker and more heartfelt path for donors desiring 
                            to contribute to their local community.
